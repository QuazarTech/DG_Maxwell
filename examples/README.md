# DG Maxwell examples.

This directory contains the examples demonstrating the usage of
some of the `dg_maxwell` library functions.

## Dependencies
The examples are written in Jupyter notebooks. So, apart from
installation of the main `dg_maxwell` dependencies shown
[here](../README.md), [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) also needs
to be installed to run the examples.

## Running Examples
First, a Jupyter server needs to started by entering this command in
a terminal,

```bash
$ jupyter-notebook
```

Among the outputs of the above command, there will be an link on which
jupyter server is hosted, it will look something like this
```bash
  http://localhost:8888/?token=58ec8707ab7b1fade9667b783455f4ccc9af5aa95dd6a65e
```

Open the link in your browser. The website will show the local directories.
Navigate to the `DG_Maxwell/examples` directory on that web page and locate
the example you want to run. Click on the file to open the example.

Read [Jupyter Documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
