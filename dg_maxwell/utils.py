def add(a, b):
    '''

    For broadcasting purposes, To sum two arrays of different
    shapes, A function which can sum two variables is required.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : arrayfire.Array [N M 1 1]
        One of the arrays which need to be broadcasted and summed.
    
    b : arrayfire.Array [1 M L 1]
        One of the arrays which need to be broadcasted and summed.
    
    Returns
    -------
    add : arrayfire.Array [N M L 1]  
          returns the sum of a and b. When used along with af.broadcast
          can be used to sum different size arrays.

    '''
    add = a + b

def divide(a, b):
    '''

    For broadcasting purposes, To divide two arrays of different
    shapes, A function which can sum two variables is required.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    a : arrayfire.Array [N M 1 1]
        One of the arrays which need to be broadcasted and divided.
    
    b : arrayfire.Array [1 M L 1]
        One of the arrays which need to be broadcasted and divided.
    
    Returns
    -------
    quotient : arrayfire.Array [N M L 1]
               The quotient a / b. When used along with af.broadcast
               can be used to give quotient of two different size arrays
               by dividing elements of the broadcasted array.

    '''
    quotient = a / b
    
    return quotient


def multiply(a, b):

    Returns
    -------
    product : arrayfire.Array [N M L 1]
              The product a * b . When used along with af.broadcast
              can be used to give quotient of two different size arrays
              by multiplying elements of the broadcasted array.
